a)* Which statements about the session layer are correct?  
It is responsible for data compression and encryption. It is the 6th layer in the ISO/OSI model.  
It is responsible for maintaining sessions over (multiple) connections on the transport layer.  

b)* What is meant by authentication?  
Encryption Identity control Authorization Access protection  

c)* Which statements about DNS are correct?  
In DNS, the names of the mail servers for the respective domain are stored. The root servers know all domains.  
DNS messages are generally transmitted encrypted. The DNS primarily serves to translate so-called FQDNs into IP addresses.  

d)* Which statements about name servers and resolvers are correct?  
Resolvers allow recursive queries. Name servers allow recursive queries.  
Name servers are authoritative for one or more zones. There is a primary resolver for each zone.  
Name servers resolve any FQDNs.  

e)* What is the FQDN for the PTR record for the IP address 192.168.1.254?  
192.168.1.254.in-addr.arpa. There is no PTR record for this IP as it is a private address.  
254.1.168.192.ip6.arpa.  
254.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  
192.168.1.254.ip6.arpa.  

f)* Which statements about resource records are correct?  
For a domain, there can be multiple resource records of the same type. Each domain must have exactly one resource record assigned.  
For a domain, there can be multiple resource records. There is exactly one SOA record per zone.  

g)* A symbol from a memoryless, discrete source has an occurrence probability of 12.5%. What is the information content of the symbol?  
0.375 bit 3 bit  
One can only specify the information content of the source, not the individual symbols. To calculate, one needs the occurrence probabilities of the remaining symbols.  

h)* Which statements about Fourier series or Fourier transformations are correct?  
The spectrum of a signal that is neither point-symmetric nor axis-symmetric is complex.  
Using Fourier series, periodic time signals can be represented.  
Using Fourier transformation, periodic time signals can be represented.  
Using Fourier transformation, aperiodic time signals can be represented. The spectrum of a point-symmetric and axis-symmetric signal is complex.  

i)* Addresses of the ISO/OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer) are used to...  
uniquely identify applications in a local network to the recipients of a packet over multiple hops.  
address the next hop on the route from the source to the destination.  
identify loops in the network.  

j)* What is 213?  
16384 16383 4095 128 65536  
8191 8192 4096 127 65535  

k)* What information must a routing table contain at a minimum?  
Destination Next-Hop Interface  
Source Cost MAC Address  

l)* Given an IP address, multiple entries in a routing table can match. Which statements apply to the entry selected at the end?  
It is the entry with the longest prefix. The entry can always be chosen randomly.  
It is the interface with the most routes. It is always the default gateway.  
It is the entry with the lowest cost. It is the interface with the highest data rate.  

m)* CRC can...  
detect and correct all transmission errors. detect all transmission errors.  
detect certain specific transmission errors. correct the detected errors at all times.  

n)* Which fields are found in the TCP header?  
Source Address Destination Port Push Flag Fragment Offset  
Sequence Number Protocol Window TTL/Hop Limit  

o)* How long is an IPv6 address?  
64B 6B 32B 48B 6bit  
16bit 8B 128bit 128B 32bit
