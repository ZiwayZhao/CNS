**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (8 Points)  
The following tasks are Multiple Choice/Multiple Answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Subtasks with only one correct answer will be awarded 1 point if correct. Subtasks with more than one correct answer will be graded with 1 point for each correct and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per subtask is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers  
Marks can be crossed out by complete filling  
Crossed out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings  

a) *Given is a signal with a power of 12 mW as well as a noise power of 5 mW. What is the value of the signal-to-noise ratio in this case?  
3.80 dB 12.63 dB 0.38 dB 8.75 dB 2.53 dB 2.40  

b) *Given is a packet of length 1200 B, which is to be transmitted in a wired network over a distance of 200 km at a data rate of 100 Mbit/s. Determine the time until the complete receipt of the packet at the destination.  
0.68 ms 0.76 ms 1.01 ms 1.10 ms other value  

c) *Which statements about Token Passing are correct?  
Token Passing forms a logical ring topology.  
Token Passing is a deterministic method.  
Using Token Passing can lead to collisions.  
A station may only send after it has forwarded the token.  

d) *Which of the following factors can influence a signal in a transmission channel?  
Interference Binomial factors Anti-factor  
Factor decomposition Noise Sieb filter  

e) *Given is a channel with independent and uniformly distributed bit error probability p = 0.2%. Determine the probability that a codeword of length 4 bits is transmitted without errors.  
0.16% other value 99.20% 0.00% 40.96%  

f) *Given is the baseband signal shown below, which encodes the bit sequence 0111 0001. Which line code presented in the lecture does it refer to?  
s(t)
