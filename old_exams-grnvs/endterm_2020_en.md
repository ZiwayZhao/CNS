### Task 2  
Design Your Own Smart Home (28 points)  
You want to set up your own Smart Home. From various sources, you have learned that many providers of "smart" devices do not take the issue of security very seriously. Therefore, you decide to assign your private computers and the Smart Home devices to different IPv4 subnets. The network topology is given in Figure 2.1. Both routers use NAT on interface eth0.  
All devices should be able to communicate with other devices in the same subnet and with the Internet. However, the Smart Home devices (in the Smartnet) should not be able to initiate a connection with the private computers (in the home network). Conversely, this should work to access the Smart Home controller with the laptop.

a) *Assign a meaningful IPv4 address to all interfaces in your network topology. To follow the convention, routers must always receive one of the highest possible IPs.  
eth0: 134.102.14.42  
eth2: 134.102.14.254  
R1 R2  
10.0.2.0/30 134.102.14.0/24  
Internet  
eth0:  
eth1:  
Smart Home Controller  
eth1:  
eth0:  
MAC: 79:ea:fc:b7:86:c8  
Home Network Smartnet  
10.1.0.0/28 10.2.3.0/24  
Temperature Sensor  
eth0:  
MAC: 17:6f:04:ac:01:9c  
Laptop Smart-Toaster  
eth0: eth0:  
MAC: 6e:4a:ba:f7:b5:91 MAC: d1:78:66:8f:2e:41  

Figure 2.1: Network Topology and IPv4 Addressing  

b) *Briefly argue whether this specific network topology, along with the NAT functionality, is sufficient to secure your home network.  

c) *Explain which IP address a server on the Internet appears as a communication partner when surfing the Internet with the laptop.  

d) Provide the routing table of routers R1 and R2. Provide the minimal number of routes and sort the entries in descending order of prefix length. Note the desired reachability of the subnets from one another based on the information.  

| Destination | Next Hop | Iface |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Routing Table of R1 | | |
| Destination | Next Hop | Iface |
| Routing Table of R2 | | |

e) *You want to call the HTTP web interface of your Smart Home Controller to make a "smart" toast. To do this, your laptop sends a TCP-SYN segment to the Smart Home Controller. Sketch a simple path-time diagram that considers all frames that must be transmitted over the respective connections. Indicate which Layer 2, 3, and 4 headers are contained. (The diagram does not need to be to scale. Serialization times and propagation delays can be neglected.) Assume that there are currently no mappings cached between IP and MAC addresses.  

Smart Home  
Laptop R1 R2 Controller  

f) Fill in the IPv4 header for the first Layer 3 packet sent from the laptop as per sub-task e). Assume that the headers contain no options. It should be clear whether the fields are to be interpreted as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or as an IP address.  

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

g) Now consider all three path segments from sub-task e) and enter the required information for each path segment along with the packet containing the TCP-SYN payload.  

| Src. IP: | Src. IP: | Src. IP: |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Src. Port: | Src. Port: | Src. Port: |
| Dst. IP: | Dst. IP: | Dst. IP: |
| Dst. Port: | Dst. Port: | Dst. Port: |
| Laptop → R1 | R1 → R2 | R2 → Smart Home Controller |

h) *Out of curiosity, you activate IPv6 support on both routers and want to test whether everything still works properly. With the program Wireshark, you promptly capture the following hex dump of an IP packet sent by a device in your Smartnet. Mark the different fields of the header.  
0x0000 60 04 02 14 00 2c 06 40 20 01 0d d8 00 00 00 00  
0x0010 d3 78 66 ff fe 8f 2e 41 20 01 4c a0 20 01 00 13  
0x0020 02 50 56 ff fe ba 37 ac  

i) Using the information from sub-task h): Explain what the global/64 prefix assigned to your Internet connection by your provider apparently is. Provide it in the shortened notation.  

j) Justify which device is most likely the sender of this packet.  

### Task 3  
Playing Sys-Admin for Your Own DNS Zone (8 points)  
You are the system administrator of a small company that has secured the domain grnvs.tips. Your task is to fill out the following zone file so that the requirements of the individual sub-tasks are met. The beginning of the zone file is already provided.

```
$TTL 86400 ; 1 day  
grnvs.tips. IN SOA ns.grnvs.tips. (  
hostmaster.grnvs.tips.  
164160 ; serial  
1800 ; refresh (30 minutes)  
300 ; retry (5 minutes)  
604800 ; expire (1 week)  
1800 ; nxdomain (30 minutes)  
)  
NS ns.grnvs.tips.  
NS ns2.grnvs.tips.  
A 134.102.13.8  
AAAA 2001:db8::1  
```

a) *You have already set up two name servers. These must still be entered in the zone file. The server with IP 134.102.12.1 should be the primary name server and 134.102.12.2 should act as a fallback.  

b) *When someone calls grnvs.tips or www.grnvs.tips in their browser, the same web server should respond in both cases.  

c) *The backend programmers want their own subdomain for their server. This subdomain should be reachable under backend.grnvs.tips and already has the IPs 134.102.16.1 and 2001:db20::af.  

d) *You have a contract with big-muscles.fit and want to display their ad tracker on your site. To ensure that this does not immediately catch users' attention, the subdomain content.grnvs.tips should point to the domain ads.big-muscles.fit. However, since you do not trust the company very much, you want to reduce the maximum validity of this entry to 2 hours to react quickly to changes.  

### Task 4  
WEIRDER — Space Traffic Between Inter-Space Stations (21 points)  
After admiring the technologies from Space Patrol Orion, parts of the exercise management began to ponder this. In particular, the possibilities of text message transmission led to the question: What could go wrong when trying to implement this transmission using GRNVS methods? It is assumed that TCP and IPv4 will be used for message transmission. A variant of the Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS) Space Data Link Protocol is used at Layer 2 — see Figure 4.1.  

| Field | Length |
|-------|--------|
| Transfer Frame Primary Header | 6–9 Octets |
| Operational Control Field | 4 Octets |
| Frame Error Control Field | 2 Octets |

Table 4.1: PCI of the AOS Space Data Link Protocol  

a) *What possibility does an application have to prevent the buffering of data by the TCP stack?  

b) *When can preventing buffering by the TCP stack be useful? (Justification!)  

c) *Why is it generally useful for TCP to try to buffer data? (Justification!)  

d) *Determine the maximum length of a TCP header. (Justification!)  

e) *Provide the maximum size of an IPv4 header in bytes. (Justification!)  

f) *Determine the minimum ratio of Layer 4 SDU to Layer 2 PDU for a data-containing segment of an established TCP connection. (Justification!)  

In RFC791 Section 3.2, the following statement can be found: “Every internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without further fragmentation.” (The word datagram describes a packet here.)  

g) *Justify the above statement from RFC791.  

h) *Justify how many packets are maximally needed, assuming minimal MTU, to transport a 1-byte TCP SDU.  

i) *What influence would setting the IPv4 header field DF have on the number of IPv4 packets arriving at the recipient? (Justification!)  

The above calculation assumes the use of IPv4. Below, the influence of a switch to IPv6 will be examined.  

j) *What challenge arises in determining the ratio of Layer 4 SDU to Layer 2 PDU (as in sub-task f) due to the use of IPv6?  

In the IPv6 specification RFC8200, the following passage can be found: “IPv6 requires that every link in the Internet have an MTU of 1280 octets or greater.”  

k) *Assuming the Layer 3 header can be estimated at 120 B. What does the cited RFC8200 passage imply for the number of transmitted IPv6 packets?  

To enable the use of IPv6 over the AOS Space Data Link Protocol, its MTU is set to either 1500 B or 1280 B depending on the link. In the network shown in Figure 4.1, Station Orion wants to send a Layer 3 PDU of 1400 B. All necessary address mappings are known.  

| Orion | Hydra | Challenger |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1500 B | 1280 B | |

Figure 4.1: Inter-Space Station Network  

l) *Draw the exchanged frames when IPv4 is used as the Layer 3 protocol. Indicate the used Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols.  

m) *Draw the exchanged frames when IPv6 is used as the Layer 3 protocol. Indicate the used Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols.  

### Task 5  
Data Network Over Tin Cans (10 points)  
Given the network shown below consisting of tin cans 1 and 2, which are connected by a taut string.  

| Can 1 | 10 m | Can 2 |  
|-------|------|-------|  

Figure 5.1: Direct connection of two tin cans with a taut string.  

Information is encoded in the form of the duration of a tone of a certain frequency:  
- A tone of 200 ms means a start bit  
- A tone of 100 ms means logical 1  
- A tone of 75 ms means logical 0  
- The individual tones are separated by 75 ms idle (no tone)  

The propagation delay of sound between the tin cans is assumed to be 2000 m/s.  

a) *Name the analog to the start bit in Ethernet. (No justification)  

b) *Determine the propagation delay between the cans.  

c) *From which technical aspect is the maximum achievable data rate dependent?  

d) *Determine the average achievable data rate in bits/s under the assumption that a redundancy-free data stream is to be sent.  
The string "GAD" (without quotes) is to be transmitted in ASCII encoding.  

e) *Provide the binary representation of the string to be transmitted. Mark the beginning and end of each codeword!  

f) *Determine the serialization time (including start bit) for this message.  

g) *Justify whether full-duplex communication is possible under the given circumstances.  

### Task 6  
Short Tasks (5 points)  
a) *For a path on the Internet, you have determined an MTU of 1500 B. Provide a sensible MSS for TCP connections over IPv4. Assume that you do not use TCP or IP options for the connection.  

b) *Explain why it makes sense to determine an MSS for TCP connections depending on the Layer 2 MTU and not to take an arbitrarily large value.  

c) *Why is a call to connect() required in Unix Sockets when using TCP (as opposed to UDP) before data can be sent?  

d) *You see several Layer 4 segments that A sends to B below. Two of them are lost. Enter the correct sequence numbers that B acknowledges upon receiving each respective segment. The Go-Back-N method is used.  

| A | B |  
|---|---|  
| SEQ=53 | SEQ=54 | × |  
| ACK= | SEQ=55 |  
| SEQ=56 | × |  
| ACK= | SEQ=54 |  
| SEQ=57 | ACK= |  
| ACK= |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
