Instructions for Processing  
- This exam consists of 4 pages with a total of 2 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of information.  
- The total score for this exam is 16.5 points.  
- It is prohibited to tear pages out of the exam.  
- The following resources are allowed:  
  – everything except group work, plagiarism, and any form of AI (e.g., ChatGPT)  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous sub-tasks.  
- Only those results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must generally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Do not write with red/green colors or with a pencil.  
- Turn off all electronic devices you have with you completely, store them in your bag, and close it.

**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (9 Points)  
The following tasks are Multiple Choice/Multiple Answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct for each.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer will be scored with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer will be scored with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Please mark the correct answers.  
Marks can be crossed out by complete filling.  
Crossed-out answers can be marked next to them.  

a) Given a signal with a power of 8 mW and a noise power of 14 mW. What is the value of the signal-to-noise ratio in this case?  
- 3.01 dB  
- 10.00 dB  
- 0.30 dB  
- 6.93 dB  
- 2.00 dB  

b) A signal band-limited to 1 kHz is sampled. The resulting spectrum of the sampled signal is sketched in the graphic. What sampling interval T was used?  
- 0.25 ms  
- 2.00 ms  
- 8.00 ms  
- 0.13 ms  
- 4.00 ms  

c) You receive a file of size 57 MB. There are already 73 MiB of data on your hard drive. How full is your hard drive?  
- 136.31 MB  
- 127.36 MiB  
- 118.60 MiB  
- 130.00 MB  
- 133.55 MB  
- 136.31 MiB  
- 126.62 MB  
- 130.00 MiB  
- 131.46 MB  
- 132.77 MiB  

d) What is part of the N-PDU?  
- N-SDU  
- N-ICI  
- N-IDU (N-1)-SDU  
- (N-1)-MPU  
- N-MPU  
- (N-1)-IDU  
- (N-1)-ICI  

e) Which statements about Fourier transformations are correct?  
- Used for the analysis of non-periodic signals.  
- The spectrum is continuous.  
- The spectrum is discrete.  
- Used for the analysis of periodic signals.  
- The spectrum is always limited.  
- The spectrum is always complex.

**Task 2**  
Short Tasks (7.5 Points)  
The following sub-tasks can be solved independently of each other.  

a) Given the periodic time signal \( s(t) \) below. Here, \( \omega = 2\pi \), with \( T = 1s \). Draw the corresponding spectrum \( S(f) \) including null points in the solution field.  

b) Briefly describe in your own words the difference between source coding and channel coding.  
- Source coding removes unwanted redundancy (compression).  
- Channel coding deliberately adds redundancy for the detection and correction of transmission errors.  

c) Briefly explain in your own words when a signal coding fulfills DC-free.  
- A signal is DC-free if the average of the sent signal is 0.  
- A coding fulfills DC-freeness if it converts any data into a DC-free signal.
