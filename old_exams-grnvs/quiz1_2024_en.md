Instructions for Processing  
- This exam consists of 6 pages with a total of 2 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of information.  
- The total score for this exam is 16 points.  
- The tearing out of pages from the exam is prohibited.  
- The following resources are permitted:  
  – everything except group work, plagiarism, and any form of AI (e.g., ChatGPT)  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous tasks.  
- Only such results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must fundamentally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Always answer free-text tasks in your own words. Foreign or copied answers will not be accepted.  
- Violations of the code of conduct will lead to exclusion from the bonus procedure.  
- Do not write with red/green colors or with a pencil.

**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (9 Points)  
The following tasks are multiple choice/multiple answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct for each.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer will be graded with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer will be graded with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers  
- Marks can be crossed out by completely filling them in.  
- Crossed-out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings.  

a) *In which step of message transmission can a lossless (de-)compression method be meaningfully used?  
Detection, Channel Decoding, Modulation, Source Coding, Demodulation, Channel Coding, In no step, Source Decoding, Line Coding  

b) *What is the SNR if a power of 15 mW is transmitted and a noise power of 10 µW is measured?  
∼ ∼ ∼ 31.761 dB, 1, 1500, 28.239 dB, 666.67, 1500  

c) *What codeword length is minimally required to quantize values in the interval I = [90;270] with a step size of Q maximally 0.5?  
7 bit, 1 bit, 8 bit, 9 bit, 360 bit, 180 bit  

d) *What is the first signal level if a uniformly distributed signal in the interval I = [14;18] is to be quantized with 8 levels and minimal Q quantization errors?  
13.750, 13.250, 16.000, 14.250, 14.125, 14.000  

e) *What method could the following signal have been modulated with?

In the following, we consider a layered model representing the control of a digital German ticket. Layer 1 models the generation of an Aztec code from digital ticket data or the reading of the ticket data.  

g) *What type of communication is involved in the control of the code?  
Bidirectional communication, Non-directional communication, Unidirectional communication, Tridirectional communication  
1 An Aztec code is a two-dimensional code similar to a QR or Data Matrix code.

You have the right to transmit on the frequency band from 2347 MHz to 2385 MHz at the Federal Network Agency. Now you have modulated a signal with 2-ASK on a carrier frequency of 2366 MHz and obtained the following signal s(t):  

1 (t) s e d u plit 0 m a al Sign −1 0 T 2T 3T Time t  

The signal s(t) does not fit the channel and should never be sent.  

d) *What must you do with the signal to be able to send it over the channel? Justify why this is necessary.  

0  
Note: Pay particular attention to the jumps in the signal.
