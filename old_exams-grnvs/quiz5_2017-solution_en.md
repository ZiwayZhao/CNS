### Questions:  

**a)** Which statements about the session layer are correct?  
- It is responsible for data compression and encryption.  
- It is the 6th layer in the ISO/OSI model.  
- It is responsible for maintaining sessions over multiple connections on the transport layer.  

**b)** What is meant by authentication?  
- Encryption  
- Identity control  
- Authorization  
- Access protection  

**c)** Which statements about DNS are correct?  
- In DNS, the names of the mail servers for the respective domain are stored.  
- The root servers know all domains.  
- DNS messages are generally transmitted unencrypted.  
- DNS primarily serves to translate so-called FQDNs into IP addresses.  

**d)** Which statements about name servers and resolvers are correct?  
- Resolvers allow recursive queries.  
- Name servers allow recursive queries.  
- Name servers are authoritative for one or more zones.  
- For each zone, there is a primary resolver.  
- Name servers resolve any FQDNs.  

**e)** What is the FQDN for the PTR record for the IP address 192.168.1.254?  
- 192.168.1.254.in-addr.arpa.  
- There is no PTR record for this IP as it is a private address.  
- 254.1.168.192.ip6.arpa.  
- 254.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  
- 192.168.1.254.ip6.arpa.  

**f)** Which statements about resource records are correct?  
- A domain can have multiple resource records of the same type.  
- Each domain must have exactly one resource record assigned.  
- A domain can have multiple resource records.  
- For each zone, there is exactly one SOA record.  

**g)** A symbol from a memoryless, discrete source has an occurrence probability of 12.5%. What is the information content of the symbol?  
- 0.375 bit  
- 3 bit  
- One can only specify the information content of the source, not the individual symbols.  
- To calculate, one needs the occurrence probabilities of the remaining symbols.  

**h)** Which statements about Fourier series and Fourier transformations are correct?  
- The spectrum of a signal that is neither point nor axis-symmetric is complex.  
- Using Fourier series, periodic time signals can be represented.  
- Using Fourier transformation, periodic time signals can be represented.  
- Using Fourier transformation, an aperiodic time signal can be represented.  
- The spectrum of a point and axis-symmetric signal is complex.  

**i)** Addresses of the ISO/OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer) are used to...  
- Uniquely identify applications in a local network to the recipients of a packet over multiple hops.  
- Address the next hop on the route from the source to the destination.  
- Identify loops in the network.  

**j)** What is 213?  
- 16384  
- 16,383  
- 4095  
- 128  
- 65536  
- 8191  
- 8192  
- 4096  
- 127  
- 65535

- Destination  
- Next-Hop  
- Interface  
- Source  
- Cost  
- MAC Address  

**l)** Multiple entries in a routing table can match a given IP address. Which statements are true for the entry selected at the end?  
- It is the entry with the longest prefix.  
- The entry can always be chosen randomly.  
- It is the interface with the most routes.  
- It is always the default gateway.  
- It is the entry with the lowest cost.  
- It is the interface with the highest data rate.  

**m)** CRC can...  
- Detect and correct all transmission errors.  
- Detect all transmission errors.  
- Detect certain specific transmission errors.  
- Always correct the detected errors.

- Destination Port  
- Push Flag  
- Fragment Offset  
- Sequence Number  
- Protocol  
- Window  
- TTL/Hop Limit  

**o)** How long is an IPv6 address?  
- 64B  
- 6B  
- 32B
