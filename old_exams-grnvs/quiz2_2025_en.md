  - everything except group work, plagiarism, and any form of AI (e.g., ChatGPT)  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous sub-tasks.  
- Only those results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Please do not write with red/green colors or with pencil.  

### Task 1  
Multiple Choice (6 points)  
The following tasks are Multiple Choice/Multiple Answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer are scored with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer are scored with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers  
- Marks can be crossed out by completely filling them in.  
- Crossed-out answers can be marked again by marking next to them.

a) *How many collision domains are there in the network in Figure 1.1?  
1 7 5 3 4 2 0 6  

b) *How many broadcast domains are there in the network in Figure 1.1?  
5 6 1 4 2 0 7 3  

c) Given the CRC polynomial 11011 and the message 1101100. What is the CRC checksum for the message?  
1101 Another Value 1110 1001  
1011 1111 0000 1000  

d) *Which statement(s) apply to the MAC address 74:9C:8F:4F:1E:DD?  
Multicast Locally administered Bicast  
Unicast Globally unique Broadcast  

e) *A notebook NB1 sends a frame to notebook NB2 over WLAN. Both are connected to the access point AP. Which Layer 2 addresses are contained in the header of the frame sent by NB1?  
NB1, NB2 and AP NB1 and NB2 NB1 and AP NB2 and AP  

### Task 2  
Transmission Time (3 points)  
You are sending a radio message from the space station INTERPLANAR XII to Earth. The distance between Earth and INTERPLANAR XII is currently 300 light-seconds. The 5MB large message is transmitted at a rate of 10 kbit/s.  
Note: 1 light-second (Ls) is the distance light travels in a vacuum in exactly one second. Specifically, it holds that  
1 Ls = 1 s, c = 3 x 10^5 km.  

How many minutes does it take until the message has completely arrived on Earth?  
0  
1  
2  
3  

### Task 3  
Switching ARP (6 points)  
We consider the following topology where PC1 wants to communicate with PC3. Since PC1 only knows the IPv4 address of PC3, address resolution with ARP is necessary. Assume that the ARP caches of the PCs and the switching table of the switch are empty.  
Decide in the following sub-tasks whether a PC is affected (yes) or not (no) and briefly justify your decision in bullet points. The justification can be identical for multiple PCs!  

**Figure 3.1: Network Topology**  
a) *Which PCs receive the ARP request sent by PC1?  
0  
1 Received yes/no Justification  
2 PC1  
PC2  
PC3  
PC4  

b) Which PCs respond to the ARP request from PC1 with an ARP reply?  
0  
1 Responds yes/no Justification  
2 PC1  
PC2  
PC3  
PC4  

c) Which PCs receive the ARP reply from PC3?  
0  
1 Received yes/no Justification  
2 PC1  
PC2  
PC3  
PC4
