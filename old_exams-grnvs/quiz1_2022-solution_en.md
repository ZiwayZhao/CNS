Instructions for Processing  
- Do not forget to sign the behavioral rules at the top of this page or enter your name.  
- This exam consists of 4 pages with a total of 2 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of information.  
- The total number of points for this exam is 15 points. These will be normalized to the point values specified in the bonus system.  
- It is prohibited to tear pages out of the exam.  
- The following aids are permitted:  
  - everything except group work and plagiarism  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous tasks.  
- Only those results will be evaluated where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must generally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Do not write with red/green colors or with pencil.

**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (8 Points)  
The following tasks are multiple choice/multiple answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer will be awarded 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer will be scored with 1 point per correct answer and 1 point per incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Please mark the correct answers.  
Correct answers can be crossed out by complete filling.  
Crossed out answers can be marked next to be crossed out again.  

a) Given is a signal with a power of 12 mW and a noise power of 15 mW. What is the signal-to-noise ratio in this case?  
- 3.80 dB  
- 12.63 dB  
- 0.38 dB  
- 8.75 dB  
- 2.53 dB  
- 2.40 dB  

b) Given is a packet of length 1200 B, which is to be transmitted in a wired network over a distance of 200 km at a data rate of 100 Mbit/s. Determine the time until the complete receipt of the packet at the destination.  
- 0.68 ms  
- 0.76 ms  
- 1.01 ms  
- 1.10 ms  
- other value  

c) Which statements about Token Passing are correct?  
- Token Passing forms a logical ring topology.  
- Token Passing is a deterministic procedure.  
- When using Token Passing, collisions can occur.  
- A station may only send after it has forwarded the token.  

d) Which of the following factors can influence a signal in a transmission channel?  
- Interference  
- Binomial factors  
- Anti-factor  
- Factor decomposition  
- Noise  

e) Given is a channel with independent and identically distributed bit error probability p = 0.2%. Determine the probability that a codeword of length 4 bits is transmitted without error.  
- 0.16%  
- other value  
- 99.20%  
- 0.00%  
- 40.96%  

f) Given is the baseband signal depicted below, which encodes the bit sequence 0111 0001. What line code presented in the lecture does it represent?  
- RZ  
- Manchester  
- NRZ  
- MLT-3  
- PAM-4

**Task 2**  
Short Tasks (7 Points)  
The following sub-tasks can be solved independently of each other.  

a) Briefly describe in your own words what is meant by (digital) modulation.  
A possible (very concise) answer would be: The imprinting of a baseband signal onto a carrier signal.  

b) What is meant by an L2-PDU?  
- LN-SDU = LN + 1 - PDU  
- LN-PDU = LN-SDU + LN-Header  

c) Given is the adjacency matrix A below. Draw the corresponding network.  
\[  
A = \begin{pmatrix}  
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\  
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\  
1 & 0 & 1 & 0  
\end{pmatrix}  
\]  

d) Given is the periodic time signal \( s(t) \) below. Here, \( \omega = 2\pi \) with \( T = 1s \). Draw the spectrum corresponding to \( s(t) \) in the solution field.
