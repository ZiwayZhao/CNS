Instructions for Processing  
- This exam consists of 4 pages with a total of 2 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of materials.  
- The total score for this exam is 15.5 points.  
- It is prohibited to tear out pages from the exam.  
- Allowed resources are:  
  - everything except group work, plagiarism, and any form of AI (e.g., ChatGPT)  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous sub-tasks.  
- Only those results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must generally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Do not write with red/green colors or with pencil.  
- Turn off all electronic devices you have with you completely, store them in your bag, and close it.

**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (8 Points)  
The following tasks are multiple choice/multiple answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct for each.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer will be graded with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer will be graded with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers  
- Marks can be crossed out by complete filling.  
- Crossed-out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings.  

a) * Given a signal with power 8 mW and a noise power of 4 mW. What is the value of the signal-to-noise ratio in this case?  
3.01 dB 10.00 dB 0.30 dB 6.93 dB 2.00 dB 2.00  

b) * A band-limited signal at 1 kHz is sampled. The resulting spectrum of the sampled signal is sketched in the graphic. What sampling interval T was used?  
0.25 ms 2.00 ms 8.00 ms 0.13 ms 4.00 ms  

c) * You receive a file of size 57 MB. Your hard drive already contains 73 MiB of data. How full is your hard drive?  
136.31 MB 127.36 MiB 118.60 MiB 130.00 MB 133.55 MB  
136.31 MiB 126.62 MB 130.00 MiB 131.46 MB 132.77 MiB  

d) * What is part of the N-PDU?  
N-SDU N-ICI N-IDU (N-1)-SDU  
(N-1)-MPU N-MPU (N-1)-IDU (N-1)-ICI  

e) * Which statements about Fourier transformations are correct?  
Used for the analysis of non-periodic signals - The spectrum is continuous.  
The spectrum is discrete.  
Used for the analysis of periodic signals.  
The spectrum is always limited.  
The spectrum is always complex.

**Task 2**  
Short Tasks (7.5 Points)  
The following sub-tasks can be solved independently of each other.  

a) * Given the periodic time signal \( s(t) \) below. Here, \( \omega = 2\pi \), with \( T = 1s \). Draw the spectrum corresponding to \( s(t) \) in the solution field, including null points.  

b) * Briefly describe in your own words the difference between source coding and channel coding.  

c) * Briefly explain in your own words when a signal coding fulfills DC-free.
