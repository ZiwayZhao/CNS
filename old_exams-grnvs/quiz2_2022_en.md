Multiple Choice (9 Points)  
The following tasks are Multiple Choice/Multiple Answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer are awarded 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer are scored with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

×  
Mark the correct answers  
(cid:4)  
Marks can be crossed out by complete filling  
×(cid:4)  
Crossed-out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings  

a)* Which statement(s) apply to the MAC address 33:33:fe:3b:88:3c?  
- Globally unique  
- Unicast  
- Globally administered  
- Locally administered  
- Multicast  
- Broadcast  

b) Given is the date 0x5e6b137d in Little Endian. What is the representation in Big Endian?  
- 0x5e6b137d  
- 0xb6e5d731  
- 0xd731b6e5  
- 0x7d136b5e  
- 0xe5b631d7  

c) Which of the following IPv4 addresses can be used as host addresses in the subnet 192.168.255.255/18?  
- 192.168.254.254  
- 192.168.1.1

- 192.168.255.255  
- 192.168.192.25  

d)* You observe a UDP segment with the header from Figure 1.1. What service is the sender likely trying to use?  
- 0x0000 d0 2c 00 35  
- 0x0004 00 26 a9 86  
Figure 1.1: Hex dump of a UDP header, in Network Byte Order  
- DHCP  
- HTTP  
- HTTPS  
- SSH  
- DNS  
- FTP  

e)* You observe a UDP datagram with port 80 as the destination. Which of the following reactions from the recipient is most likely?  
- A 3-Way Handshake  
- A response via UDP  
- Acknowledgment of the segment  
- A response with an ACK  
- The request is discarded  
- A response via TCP  

f) You have established a TCP connection, which is already in the Congestion Avoidance phase. The current size of the Congestion Window is w = 55 (MSS). You receive 3 duplicate ACKs. What applies next for c? Assume TCP Reno as introduced in the lecture.  
- c ≥ w  
- c < 34  
- It remains the same  
- w = 56

b)* Briefly explain under what circumstances IP must be fragmented.  

c)* Where does fragmentation and reassembly occur in IPv4 and IPv6, respectively?  

d)* Briefly explain the purpose and function of the TTL field in IPv4.
