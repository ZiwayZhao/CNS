a)* Please check the relevant properties of the information content of a memoryless source:  
× g  
The information content of a predictable symbol is 0 bits.  
×  
The information content is maximized when each of the N symbols occurs with probability 1/N.  
The more frequently a symbol occurs, the higher its information content.  
The information content of a string of symbols is the product of the information content of the individual symbols.  
b)* Given the rectangular impulse s(t) and the cos² impulse s(t). Figure 1.1 shows four different spectra. Which statements are correct?

e)* Which statements about channel coding are correct? g  
×  
Transmission errors can be detected within a limited scope.  
a  
Channel coding serves data compression.  
×  
Structured redundancy is added to the data to be transmitted.  
l  
Channel coding aims to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted.  
Channel coding is rarely required today, as the transmission channels are reliable enough.  
× c  
Transmission errors can be corrected within a limited scope.  
s  
f)* What is meant by a Gray code?  
A code that excludes decoding errors.  
r  
×  
Decoding errors of adjacent symbols are limited to 1 bit error.  
o  
A code where adjacent code words have a Hamming distance of more than 1.  
×  
A code where adjacent code words have a Hamming distance of exactly 1.  
g)* Mark all code words that have a Hamming distance of two or less from the code word 0110.
