**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (7 points)  
The following tasks are multiple choice/multiple answer, i.e., at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer are scored with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer are scored with 1 point per correct answer and 1 point per incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Please mark the correct answers.  
Marks can be crossed out by completely filling them in.  
Crossed-out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings.  

a) Which of the following IPv4 addresses can be used as host addresses in the subnet 192.168.255.255/22?  
- 192.168.246.1  
- 192.168.1.1  
- 192.168.254.254  
- 192.168.252.25  
- 192.168.255.255  

b) Which of the following other /21 IPv4 prefixes can be combined with the network 10.0.208.0/21 to form a /20 network?  
- 10.0.248.254  
- 10.0.240.0  
- 10.0.200.216  
- 10.0.216.0  
- 10.0.0.216  
- 10.0.200.0  
- 127.0.0.1  

c) Which of the following IPv4 subnet masks corresponds to a /10 network?  
- 255.255.255.255  
- 255.128.0.0  
- 255.192.0.0  
- 255.240.0.0  
- 255.248.0.0  
- 0.63.255.255  
- 0.0.0.0  
- 255.224.0.0  

d) * To which layer of the ISO/OSI model does ICMPv6 belong?  
- Layer 6  
- Layer 1  
- Layer 4  
- Layer 2  
- Layer 7  
- Layer 5  
- Layer 3  

e) * Which statements about the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) are correct?  
- Since updates are only sent every 15 seconds, there is a maximum delay of 17 * 15 seconds = 4.25 minutes.  
- The maximum distance for RIP is 128 hops.  
- In the event of a route failure, a "Count to infinity" occurs.  
- RIP is not used as an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP).  
- It may take several "rounds" before each router can determine the best next hop.

**Task 2**  
IPv6 Addresses & SLAAC (7.5 points)  

a) * Given the IPv6 address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0001. Provide this in fully zero-compressed notation.  

b) * Given the MAC address 33:44:55:66:77:88 of a network device. Determine the corresponding IPv6 Link-Local address as it is normally generated via SLAAC and briefly describe its structure.  

c) Can the generated Link-Local address be used locally without any issues?  

d) Can the generated Link-Local address be used to communicate on the internet?  

Additional space for solutions. Clearly mark the assignment to each sub-task. Do not forget to cross out invalid solutions.
