a)* Please mark the relevant properties of the information content of a memoryless source:  
The information content of a predictable symbol is 0 bits.  
The information content is maximized if each of the N symbols occurs with a probability of 1/N.  
The more frequently a symbol occurs, the higher its information content.  
The information content of a string of symbols is the product of the information contents of the individual symbols.  
b)* Given are the rectangular pulse s(t) and the cosine squared pulse s(t). Figure 1.1 shows four different spectra. Which statements are correct?

d)* A value-continuous signal is to be quantized in the interval I = [−2; 2] such that the minimum quantization error within I is at most 1/2. How many quantization levels are required at a minimum?

e)* Which statements about channel coding are correct?  
Transmission errors can be detected to a limited extent.  
Channel coding serves data compression.  
Structured redundancy is added to the data being transmitted.  
Channel coding aims to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted.  
Channel coding is rarely required today as the transmission channels are reliable enough.  
Transmission errors can be corrected to a limited extent.  
f)* What is meant by a Gray code?  
A code that excludes decoding errors.  
Decoding errors of adjacent symbols are limited to 1 bit error.  
A code where adjacent code words have a Hamming distance of more than 1.  
A code where adjacent code words have a Hamming distance of exactly 1.  
g)* Mark all code words that have a Hamming distance of two or less from the code word 0110.

h)* Given is a time-continuous and value-continuous signal s(t). Please mark the relevant statements.  
Sampling s(t) results in a time-discrete and value-continuous signal.  
Quantizing s(t) results in a value-discrete and time-continuous signal.  
Quantizing s(t) results in a time-discrete and value-continuous signal.  
Sampling s(t) results in a value-discrete and time-continuous signal.  
i)* Which statements about the sampling theorem of Shannon-Hartley are correct?  
From a band-limited signal on B, one can obtain up to B distinguishable symbols.  
From a band-limited signal on B, one can obtain up to 2B distinguishable symbols.  
With M distinguishable symbols, the maximum achievable data rate is 2B log(M) bits.  
With M distinguishable symbols, the maximum achievable data rate is 2B log(M) bits.
