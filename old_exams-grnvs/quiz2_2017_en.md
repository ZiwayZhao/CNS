a) *Which statements about Token Passing are correct?  
Token Passing is a deterministic procedure.  
A station may only send after it has forwarded the token.  
Token Passing is a media access method.  
Using Token Passing can lead to collisions.  

b) *What are suitable methods to detect when a frame begins?  
Code rule violation  
Huffman coding  
OFDM or QAM  
Prefixing with delimiter fields  
Control characters  
CRC  

c) *Which statements about MAC addresses in IEEE 802.3 networks are correct?  
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is the broadcast address.  
Each device has its own unique MAC address.  
MAC addresses consist of a manufacturer-specific and a device-specific part.  
There are no multicast addresses.  

d) *Ethernet frames have a 2-byte type field (Ethertype). What is this field used for?  
To specify the frame length.  
To specify the type of the L3 PDU.  
To indicate what type of payload follows.  
To specify the type of the frame.  

e) *Which statements about CRC in connection with Ethernet are correct?  
CRC is used for correcting transmission errors.  
The FCS of Ethernet frames is based on 4-byte CRC sums.  
CRC is used for detecting transmission errors.  
The reduction polynomial is of degree n + 1, where n denotes the length of the resulting checksum in bits.  
CRC is complex to calculate and is therefore only used in linksmith with higher bit error probability.  

f) *Which statements about hubs and switches are correct?  
Hubs break broadcast domains.  
Switches break broadcast domains.  
Hubs make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses.  
Switches break collision domains.  
Hubs break collision domains.  
Hubs can amplify signals at the physical layer.  
Switches make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses.  

g) *Ethernet frames have a 2-byte type field (Ethertype). What is this field used for?  
To specify the type of the L3 PDU.  
To indicate what type of payload follows.  
To specify the frame type.  
To specify the frame length.  

h) *For what reason does Ethernet not use acknowledgments at layer 2, but WLAN does?  
The frame error probability in WLAN is so low compared to Ethernet that higher layer protocols can function without acknowledgments.  
The frame error probability in WLAN is so high compared to Ethernet that higher layer protocols would not function.  
Because RTS/CTS does not work in WLAN.  

i) *Which statements about 4B5B encoding are correct?  
Control characters are prepared.  
It is a code for error correction.  
It is a code for error detection.  
It is another designation for the ASCII code.  
It maps 4-bit long inputs to 5-bit long code words.  

j) *Which statements about WLAN frames are correct?  
Frames in WLAN are generally longer than in wired networks like Ethernet, as media access in wireless transmissions is time-consuming.  
Frames in WLAN are generally shorter than in wired networks like Ethernet, as the bit error probability in wireless transmissions is higher.  
Frames to broadcast and multicast addresses are not acknowledged.  
All WLAN frames are fundamentally acknowledged at layer 2.
