**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (7 Points)  
The following tasks are multiple choice/multiple answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer will be graded with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer will be graded with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers.  
Marks can be crossed out by complete filling.  
Crossed-out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings.  

a) You encode a message with the (7,4)-Hamming code, which has a code rate of R = 4, and receive an encoded message of size 1792 B. How large is the original message?  
1,024 KiB 3,136 KiB 1024 B 3,063 kB 1 KiB 3136 B  

b) Which statement(s) apply to the MAC address 64:1D:EB:44:1E:CC?  
Multicast Unicast Bicast  
Globally unique Locally administered Broadcast  

c) Which statement(s) are correct regarding G1 and G2 in the network topology in Figure 1.1?  
G1 and G2 are Access Points G1 and G2 are Bridges  
G1 and G2 are Switches G1 and G2 are Hubs  

d) Which statement(s) are correct regarding G3 in the network topology in Figure 1.1?  
G3 is an Access Point G3 is a Hub G3 is a Switch G3 is a Bridge  

e) How many collision domains are there in the network in Figure 1.1?  
9 5 8 2 7 6 3 1 4 10

**Task 2**  
Short Tasks (2 Points)  
The network topology in Figure 1.1 is tendentially problematic. You notice that communication between PC1 and PC2 does not function as desired.  
What could be the cause of this problem? How can such problems generally be resolved or avoided?

**Task 3**  
Legend of the Galactic High-Speed Communication (6 Points)  
In a distant future, humanity has settled hundreds of star systems. After capturing the fortress Iserlohn through a trick, you want to transmit the enemy's information database from the fortress to the capital planet Heinessen, which are exactly d = 4010 light-years apart. The database has a total of 958 PiB = 980,992 TiB.  

For the transmission of the 958 PiB, three different channels with the following properties are available:  
1. Laser-based transmission  
2. FTL (Faster Than Light) communication channel  
3. Transport of data carriers through the vacuum for transmission from an FTL spaceship  

- Transmission rate  
- Flight duration of the spaceship: 21 days  
- Propagation delay  
  r1 = 3.8 Tibit/s  
  t = 64 ms  
- Relative propagation speed ν = 1 ≈  
  t 2280.17 a  
- Data serialization time  
- Copying duration of the data onto the data carrier: 5 days  

You are asked to determine which variant will get the data to Heinessen the fastest. Provide all time indications and probabilities in meaningful units rounded.  

a) What is the propagation delay of Variant 1?  

b) What is the serialization time of Variant 1?  

c) Which of the variants is the fastest?  
FTL spaceship FTL communication channel Laser-based transmission  

The database was transferred onto a total of 40 data carriers in 5 days. The transport of the data carriers in an FTL spaceship is error-prone, as the data can be damaged due to solar storms. This occurs independently for each data carrier with a probability of 1 on 42.  

d) With what probability do all 40 data carriers arrive without errors?  

1 light-year is the distance light travels in a vacuum in exactly one year.  
The framework of this task is based on the Sci-Fi novel series "Legend of the Galactic Heroes" by Yoshiki Tanaka.  
Abbreviation for Faster Than Light, i.e., faster than the speed of light.  
1 a means 1 year.
