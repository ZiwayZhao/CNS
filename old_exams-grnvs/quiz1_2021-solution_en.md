Instructions for Processing  
- This exam consists of 4 pages with a total of 2 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of information.  
- The total score for this exam is 15 points. This will be scaled to 2 points for the final grade according to the bonus procedure.  
- The tearing out of pages from the exam is prohibited.  
- The following aids are permitted:  
  - L – all electronic and non-electronic aids  
  - Group work of any kind is not allowed  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous sub-tasks.  
- Only those results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must generally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Please write with red/green colors or with a pencil.

### Task 1  
Multiple Choice (4 Points)  
The following tasks are Multiple Choice/Multiple Answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer are rated with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer are rated with 0.5 points for each correct mark and 0.5 points for each incorrect answer. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers  

* Which edges are included in the Minimum Spanning Tree of the adjacent graph?  
  - (B,D)  
  - (A,B)  
  - (A,E)  
  - (G,D)  
  - (C,D)  
  - (F,G)  

* Which edges are included in the Shortest Path Tree with root G of the adjacent graph?  
  - (E,C)  
  - (A,C)  
  - (B,A)  
  - (E,A)  
  - (B,D)  

* Mark all code words that have a Hamming distance of three or more from the code word 0011.  
  - 0001  
  - 1100  
  - 1001  
  - 1110  
  - 0000  
  - 1111

### Task 2  
Short Questions (11 Points)  

* What is meant by a bandpass?  
  A channel (or a filter) that dampens frequencies outside a defined range.  

* What is meant by channel coding?  
  The deliberate addition of redundancy.  

* Explain one advantage of UTP over STP.  
  STP shields better against external influences than UTP. UTP is cheaper to produce than STP.  

* Given the binary message 0111 0001. What is the resulting send signal when MLT-3 is used as the line code?  

* Given a channel with a bandwidth of 654 Mbit/s, over which a message of length 1148 B is to be transmitted. Determine the serialization time.  
  \( t = \frac{1148 B}{654 Mbit/s} \approx 14.04 \mu s \)  

* Provide an example of a signal space assignment that is uniquely QAM and cannot be confused with any other type of signal space assignment.  

* Given a channel with a bandwidth of 36 MHz. Determine the minimum necessary signal-to-noise ratio in dB so that a data rate of 95 Mbit/s is possible.  
  \( r = \log_2(1 + SNR) \Rightarrow SNR = 2^{(r/B)} - 1 \approx 7.18 dB \)  

* What is the difference between code and time multiplexing?  
  Multiplexing describes the multiple access of participants to a shared medium. The medium remains open as it is divided among the participants. For example:  
  - Code multiplexing: Participants use orthogonal alphabets for their messages.  
  - Time multiplexing: Participants are assigned time slots during which they may use the medium.  

* Determine the entropy of source Q. Justify with an explanation or calculation. The source Q always periodically outputs the following sequence:  
  \( X \in \{A, B, C\} \)  
  \( Q: ABCCBAABCCBAABCCBA... \)  
  Since it is always 100% certain which character will be output, the entropy is equal to 0.
