Instructions for Processing  
- This exam consists of 4 pages with a total of 2 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of information.  
- The total score for this exam is 15 points. This will be scaled to 2 points according to the bonus procedure for calculating the final grade.  
- Removing pages from the exam is prohibited.  
- The following aids are permitted:  
  - all electronic and non-electronic aids  
  - group work of any kind is not allowed  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous tasks.  
- Only those results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must generally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Do not write with red/green colors or with pencil.  

### Task 1  
Multiple Choice (4 Points)  
The following tasks are Multiple Choice/Multiple Answer, meaning at least one answer option is correct.  
Sub-tasks with only one correct answer are rated with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer are rated with 0.5 points per correct mark and 0.5 points per incorrect answer. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Please mark the correct answers  
- Correct answers can be crossed out by complete filling.  
- Crossed-out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings.  

a)* Which edges are included in the Minimum Spanning Tree of the adjacent graph?  
- (B,D) (A,B) (A,E) (G,D) (C,D) (F,G)  

b)* Which edges are included in the Shortest Path Tree with root G of the adjacent graph?  

c)* Mark all code words that have a Hamming distance of three or more from the code word 0011.  
- 0001 1100 1001 1110 0000 1111  

### Task 2  
Short Questions (11 Points)  
a)* What is meant by a bandpass?  

b)* What is meant by channel coding?  

c)* Explain one advantage of UTP over STP.  

d)* Given the binary message 0111 0001. Provide the resulting transmission signal when MLT-3 is used as the line code.  

e)* Given a channel with a bandwidth of 654 Mbit/s, over which a message of length 1148 B is to be transmitted. Determine the serialization time.  

f)* Provide an example of a signal space assignment that is uniquely QAM and cannot be confused with any other type of signal space assignment.  

g)* Given a channel with a bandwidth of 36 MHz. Determine the minimum necessary signal-to-noise ratio in dB for a data rate of 95 Mbit/s to be possible.  

h)* What is the difference between code multiplexing and time multiplexing?  

i)* Determine the entropy of source Q. Justify with an explanation or calculation. The source Q periodically outputs the following sequence:  
- X ∈ {A, B, C}  
- Q: ABCCBAABCCBAABCCBA...  

### Additional Space for Solutions. Clearly mark the assignment to each sub-task. Do not forget to cross out invalid solutions.
