Instructions for Completion  
- This exam consists of 4 pages with a total of 3 tasks. Please check now that you have received a complete set of information.  
- The total score for this exam is 15 points.  
- The tearing out of pages from the exam is prohibited.  
- The following resources are allowed:  
  – everything except group work, plagiarism, and any form of AI (e.g., ChatGPT)  
- Tasks marked with * can be solved without knowledge of the results of previous tasks.  
- Only those results will be graded where the solution path is recognizable. Text tasks must generally be justified unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective sub-tasks.  
- Do not write with red/green colors or with pencil.  
- Turn off all electronic devices completely, store them in your bag, and close it.

**Task 1**  
Multiple Choice (7 points)  
The following tasks are multiple choice/multiple answer, meaning that at least one answer option is correct for each. Sub-tasks with only one correct answer will be graded with 1 point if correct. Sub-tasks with more than one correct answer will be graded with 1 point for each correct answer and 1 point for each incorrect mark. Missing marks have no effect. The minimum score per sub-task is 0 points.  

Mark the correct answers  
- Marks can be crossed out by complete filling.  
- Crossed out answers can be marked again by adjacent markings.  

a) *Which statements about Token Passing are correct?  
- Token Passing is a media access method.  
- A station may only send after it has forwarded the token.  
- Token Passing can lead to collisions.  
- Token Passing is a deterministic method.  

b) *You observe the following data stream from an unknown source. Determine the information content of the character Z.  
T B A B T T B Z B U Z A B T B Z A Z U T U U Z T B  
- 1.61 bit  
- 5 bit  
- 1.61 bit  
- 2.32 bit  
- 4.0 bit  

c) *You observe the following data stream from another unknown source. The source seems to output all characters twice. Determine the information content of the second character Z, after the first has already been output.  
Z Z A A U U B B B A A U U Z B B Z Z Z T B B B  
- 1.32 bit  
- 15 bit  
- 1.91 bit  
- 1.91 bit  
- 4.0 bit  

d) *The signal x(t) = 1 cos(6πt) is sampled. What is the minimum sampling frequency required for lossless reconstruction from the 5 sample values?  
- 1.20 Hz  
- 2.40 Hz  
- 6.00 Hz  
- 12.00 Hz  
- 3.00 Hz  

e) *A signal is to be linearly quantized in the interval L = [3, 3]. The signal values are to be assigned to 8 possible code words. What is the maximum quantization error for values in the interval L?  
- 0.19  
- 0.75  
- 0.38  
- 2.67  
- 5.33  

f) *How many collision domains does the adjacent network consist of?  
- 5  
- 6  
- 1  
- 3

**Task 2**  
MAC Addresses (4 points)  
You receive the following byte stream of an Ethernet frame:  
80 7b 1e 02 1a a6 00 25 90 57 22 4a 08 00  

a) *Provide the recipient and sender address in their usual form.  
Recipient address: 80:7b:1e:02:1a:a6  
Sender address: 00:25:90:57:22:4a  

b) Is the recipient address a globally unique address? Justify your answer.  
OUI: 80:7b:1e, LG bit: 0, globally unique  

c) *Which protocol is likely used at layer 3? Justify your answer.  
Ethertype: 0x0800, IPv4

**Task 3**  
Short Tasks (4 points)  
The following sub-tasks can be solved independently of each other.  

a) *Given a network represented by the following undirected graph. Determine the corresponding adjacency matrix A.  
A =  
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]  

b) *Provide a meaningful signal space assignment for ASK and QAM, which is unambiguously valid only for the respective modulation type. Ensure a sufficient and meaningful set of signal space points!  
(a) ASK  
(b) QAM  

Additional space for solutions. Clearly mark the assignment to the respective sub-task. Do not forget to cross out invalid solutions.
