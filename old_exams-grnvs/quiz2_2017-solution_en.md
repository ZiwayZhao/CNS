s  
a)* Which statements about Token Passing are correct?  
× g  
Token Passing is a deterministic method.  
A station may only send after it has forwarded the token.  
n  
×  
Token Passing is a media access method.  
When using Token Passing, collisions can occur.  
b)* What are suitable methods to detect when a frame begins?  
×  
Code rule violation Huffman coding  
×  
OFDM or QAM Prefixing with delimiter fields  
×  
Control character CRC  
L  
c)* Which statements about MAC addresses in IEEE 802.3 networks are correct?  
×  
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is the broadcast address.  
×  
Each device has its own unique MAC address.  
×  
MAC addresses consist of a manufacturer-specific and a device-specific part.  
There are no multicast addresses.  
d)* Ethernet frames have a 2-byte type field (Ethertype). What is the purpose of this field generally?  
×  
To specify the frame length. To specify the type of the L3 PDU.  
×  
To indicate what type of payload follows. To specify the type of the frame.

e)* Which statements about CRC in relation to Ethernet are correct?  
CRC is used for correcting transmission errors.  
×  
The FCS of Ethernet frames is based on 4-byte CRC sums.  
×  
CRC is used for detecting transmission errors.  
The reduction polynomial is of degree n + 1, where n denotes the length of the resulting checksum in bits.  
CRC is complex to calculate and is therefore only used at the link layer for higher bit error probability.  
f)* Which statements about hubs and switches are correct?  
l  
Hubs break broadcast domains.  
h  
Switches break broadcast domains.  
c  
Hubs make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses.  
×  
Switches break collision domains.  
s  
Hubs break collision domains.  
×  
Hubs can amplify signals at the physical layer.  
×  
Switches make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses.  
g)* Ethernet frames have a 2-byte type field (Ethertype). What is the purpose of this field generally?  
× ×  
To specify the type of the L3 PDU. To indicate what type of payload follows.  
s  
To specify the frame type. To specify the frame length.  
g  
h)* For what reason does Ethernet not use acknowledgments at layer 2, but WLAN does?  
The frame error probability in WLAN is so low compared to Ethernet that higher layer protocols can function without acknowledgments.  
×  
The frame error probability in WLAN is so high compared to Ethernet that higher layer protocols would not function.  
Since RTS/CTS does not work in WLAN.  
s  
i)* Which statements about 4B5B encoding are correct?  
×  
Creates control characters ready.  
ö  
It is a code for error correction.  
L  
It is a code for error detection.  
There is another name for the ASCII code.  
×  
It maps 4-bit long inputs to 5-bit long code words.  
j)* Which statements about WLAN frames are correct?  
×  
Frames in WLAN tend to be longer than in wired networks like Ethernet, as media access in wireless transmissions is time-consuming.  
Frames in WLAN tend to be shorter than in wired networks like Ethernet, as the bit error probability in wireless transmissions is higher.  
×  
Frames to broadcast and multicast addresses are not acknowledged.  
All WLAN frames are fundamentally acknowledged at layer 2.
